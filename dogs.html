        <figcaption id="img-caption">One of the most noticeable benefits of owning a dog is that it's almost impossible to feel lonely when your dog is by your side, and for good reason. Most dogs are highly sociable, and they love company, whether it's canine or human.</figcaption>

      <h2>Here's a list of breeds and the types of personalities that these fur-babies have</h2>
      <ul id="dog-info">
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>Great Dane</strong>
  </span> - Despite their size (they are considered a "giant" breed), these dogs need a lot less space than most people imagine. They may reach a maximum height of 35 inches tall, and weigh anything up to 200llbs. However, they don't take up a lot of space as long as you  provide a nice comfy couch for them so they can snuggle with you. They love to stay at home with you and just watch netflix with you. They are perfect dogs for the family and only require a daily walk and just lots of love. They are very much gentle giants.</p></li>
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>English Bulldog</strong></span> - Due to their extremely short muzzle, these dogs don't do well with excessive amounts of exercise as they can have difficulty breathing and much more so in hot weather. They should just have two short walks per day for 20 minutes each. They should be exercised gently as they are also prone to elbow dysplasia. If you like and afternoon siesta as part of your  daily routine, this dog is an expert napper. Just make sure that sleep first due to the snoring.</p></li>
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>Saint Bernard </strong></span> - This is another giant breed, reaching a weight of 180 pounds and up to 30 inches in height. These darlings are quite lazy, and just enjoy most days lounging around enjoy watching the world go by. Grab yourself a coffee and put your feet up in the sun, and this dog will be right beside you. The only downfall is that these dogs are super drooley. So hopefully you don't care about keeping your house spotless and dry. However, that is just small price to pay to have this cutie as your best friend.</p></li>
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>Greyhound</strong></span> - Greyhoundz make an ideal jogging buddy for lots of reasons. Because of their breeding background as racing dogs, they naturally find running to be extremely fun and exciting. They reach and impressive speed of 45 miles per hour, so perhaps racing a Greyhound isn't the best idea, unless you're OK with losing! Greyhounds are extremley smart, gentle, and low maintenance dogs that will settle in very well with the family.</p></li>
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>	Cavalier King Charles Spaniel </strong></span> - This beautiful breed of dog loves quick play sessions, however doesn't generally require too much exercise. They are a perfect choice for a family pet due to their size and gentleness. They don't like being left alone for long periods of time, and they need at least one family member at home for a lot of the day. They are high maintenance in grooming, so regular trips to the groomer will keep these dogs looking beautiful.</p></li>
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>Labrador Retriever</strong></span> - This dog will be the perfect buddy in the mornings and are also extremely social, so you'll never have to worry about them being reactive to other dogs or people while you're out for a jog'. They also have a lot of strength and enjoy high energy exercise on a daily basis. Furthermore, they are so eager to learn which makes them easy to train.</p></li>
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>	Dalmatian</strong></span> - Dalmatians were initially used as hunting dogs, and then as carriage dogs. Due to their background, they enjoy going for a brisk run with their human. They're very much athletic dogs with loads of energy. However, they become destructive when left on their own for too long with nothing to do. Keep these dogs busy with a bone or dog puzzle!</p></li>
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>Siberian Husky </strong></span> Huskies were initially bred to pull sleds in very cold conditions and for long journeys. These dogs love to run more than anything! Due to their long coat, you dont want to run in the heat of the summer or they can overheat as Huskies enjoy running when they're not supposed. In fact, they will try to run every chance they get. Out the door. Out the gate. Out the window. You name it, they've probably tried it. Before owning a Husky, make sure that you're able to keep little Houdini safely contained.</p></li>
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>Beagle </strong></span> - Beagles are a bit on the smaller side, if that's what you're looking for. They make a loving and trustworthy companion for children of all ages. They love to play, and require very little grooming besides brushing. They do tend to bark though, so be prepared. They're also a little bit of a stubborn breed, but are also highly trainable and intelligent with the right approach.</p></li>
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>Golden Retriever</strong></span> - This one is not surprising. The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds today, largely due to their reputation as being a good family dog. They are exceptionally smart, even -tempered, and love pretty much everybody they meet. If you're looking for a dog that is good with young kids, the Golden Retriever would be a smart choice. They do need some regular grooming to keep their long fur from becoming dirty and matted, but generally speaking, they aren't a very high maintenance breed.</p></li>
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>Rough Collie</strong></span> - Everybody remembers Lassie and Timmy. Who could forget all of the times that Lassie saved her favorite little boy from some of the very worst situations? The Collie is extraordinarily smart, and they love to please the people they care about most. They have a calm and gentle demeanor that comes naturally, and they are also surprisingly protective for such a gentle dog. They do require regular trips to the groomers to keep their coat neat and tidy. However, there is a short-coated version that would require much less maintenance.</p></li>
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>Bernese Mountain Dog</strong></span> - The Bernese mountain dog is undoubtedly a big dog, topping out near 120 pounds. But they also have a big heart, and seem to be naturally drawn to children in particular. They're noticeably patient compared to most dogs, and are easy to train. This dog wants nothing more than to become pals with your little ones.</p></li>
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>Chihuahua</strong></span> - This dogs tiny size allows it to go just about anywhere with its owner. If you are a senior that likes taking your best friend with you as much as possible, then a Chihuahua just might be the dog for you. There is a long haired and short haired variety, but both are low maintenance. The long haired version does just fine with only a regular brushing at home.</p></li>
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>Shih Tzu</strong></span> - These little dogs require a little more grooming, but make the perfect companion for older folks. They thoroughly enjoy being pampered, and will love their owner with their whole heart. They're happy to sit on your lap and be petted for as long as you want.</p></li>
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>Dachshund</strong></span> - Another low maintenance pooch, the Dachshund comes in three different coat types. The smooth coat and long coat both require nothing more than regular brushing at home and an occasional bath. The wire-coated Dachshund will need its coat stripped at the groomer two or three times a year. They don't require a lot of exercise, and they tend to be a one person dog, so they will form a very strong bond with their senior owners.</p></li>
        <li><p class="dogs-life"><span class="bold"><strong>Pomeranian</strong></span> - These dogs also require a trip to the groomer on occasion, roughly every 4 to 6 weeks. But if you're OK with that, this tiny toy breed is just overflowing with love and affection. They also enjoy going places with their owners and fit perfectly in a shoulder bag or purse for easy carrying. They usually form the best bond with one person, and like to be near that person as much as possible.</p></li>
